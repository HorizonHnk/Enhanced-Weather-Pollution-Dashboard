# Enhanced Weather & Pollution Dashboard

## A Node-RED project that combines weather data with real-time air quality monitoring

This repository contains a Node-RED flow implementation that expands a basic weather dashboard to incorporate real-time air quality data, creating a comprehensive environmental monitoring tool. The project leverages the OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API to fetch and display pollution levels alongside weather metrics.

## Features

- Real-time weather data visualization
- Air quality monitoring using OpenWeatherMap API
- Combined dashboard with clear, user-friendly sections
- Customizable pollution level thresholds and alerts
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile viewing

## Requirements

- Node-RED installation
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- Basic knowledge of Node-RED flows and dashboard nodes

## Installation

1. Import the provided flow JSON into your Node-RED instance
2. Configure your OpenWeatherMap API key in the relevant nodes
3. Deploy the flow
4. Access your dashboard via the Node-RED UI

## Configuration

The dashboard can be configured to monitor different locations and display various pollution metrics including:
- PM2.5 and PM10 levels
- Carbon monoxide (CO)
- Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
- Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
- Ozone (O3)
